# Marley Spoon Challenge

This project is one of the most exciting projects that I work. Because it contains so many cool parts like working with Graphql and Viper and SwiftUI and Combine at the same time
## Running Project
I just use SPM so after opening Xcode and opening the project and downloading dependencies you are good to go
- I am using Swfitlint but I comment out the run script so you don't force to install Swiftlint

## Architecture
I use viper with Swiftui and Combine framework for doing this challenge. my main reason for choosing viper is it gives you more flexibility and more testability. I never used viper with Swiftui before and I think I made a big risk but I learned a lot during this challenge and it was so much valuable and interesting for me. I always try to push limits and using this architecture is so much funüçªüçª

## Unit-Tests
As you can see I tried to write some unit tests but unfortunately test coverage is not high. I try my best in approximately four hours and I continue writing more tests in a different branch in order to go the extra mile.

## Conclusion
Thank you so much for reviewing my code. I really appreciated any suggestion you have regarding code and implementation and overall it was a fun journey ü§ù  I never had a chance to work with Graphql before and write a query for it. So when I executed the first query correctly I was so happy and excited about the result and the power it has.
